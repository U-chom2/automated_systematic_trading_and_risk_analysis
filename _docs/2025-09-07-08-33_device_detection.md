# Device Detection Implementation for Training Code

## Date: 2025-09-07 08:33

## Summary
Updated the training code to automatically detect and use the appropriate device:
- **MPS** (Metal Performance Shaders) for Apple Silicon Macs
- **CUDA** for NVIDIA GPUs
- **CPU** as fallback

## Changes Made

### 1. train/train.py
- Added auto-detection logic for MPS/CUDA/CPU
- Modified `train()` method to accept `device=None` for auto-detection
- Updated device detection in `main()` function

### 2. train/models/agents/ppo_agent.py
- Added auto-detection logic in `__init__()`
- Created separate `torch_device` attribute for tensor operations
- Updated tensor operations to use `self.torch_device`

### 3. train/models/modernbert_encoder.py
- Added auto-detection logic in `__init__()`
- Created separate `torch_device` attribute
- Updated all `.to()` calls to use `self.torch_device`

### 4. src/analysis_engine/nlp_analyzer.py
- Updated device detection to support MPS
- Added logging for device selection

## Device Detection Logic
```python
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = "mps"  # Apple Silicon GPU
elif torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = "cuda:0"  # NVIDIA GPU
else:
    device = "cpu"  # CPU fallback
```

## Test Results
- Successfully tested on Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3)
- Training runs on MPS device
- Model saves and evaluates correctly
- All tensor operations work on selected device

## Usage
The code now automatically detects and uses the best available device:
```python
# Auto-detect device (recommended)
pipeline.train(device=None)

# Or explicitly specify device
pipeline.train(device="mps")  # Force MPS
pipeline.train(device="cuda:0")  # Force CUDA
pipeline.train(device="cpu")  # Force CPU
```

## Performance Notes
- MPS provides significant speedup on Apple Silicon Macs
- CUDA provides best performance on NVIDIA GPUs
- CPU fallback ensures compatibility on all systems

## Files Modified
1. `/train/train.py`
2. `/train/models/agents/ppo_agent.py`
3. `/train/models/modernbert_encoder.py`
4. `/src/analysis_engine/nlp_analyzer.py`

## Verification
Created test scripts to verify device detection:
- `test_device.py` - Tests device detection logic
- `test_training_quick.py` - Tests training with auto-detected device

Both tests pass successfully with MPS device on Apple Silicon Mac.
